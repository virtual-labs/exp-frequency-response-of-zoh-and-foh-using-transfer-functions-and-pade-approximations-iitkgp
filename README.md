### About the Experiment 

 **The Hold Operation**

In the computer-controlled systems, it is necessary to convert the control actions calculated by the computer as a sequence of numbers, to a continuous-time signal that can be applied to the process.


The problem of hold operation may be posed as follows:

Given a sequence <img src="experiment/images/y0_y1_yk.png">, we have to construct <img src="experiment/images/y_a(t)_t0.png"> 

A commonly used solution to the problem of hold operation is polynomial extrapolation. Using Taylorâ€™s series expansion about <img src="experiment/images/t_kT.png">, we can express <img src="experiment/images/ya_t.png"> as 

<img style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src= "experiment/images/eq1.png">


If only the first term in expansion (1) is used, the data hold is called a zero-order hold (ZOH). 
Here we assume that the function  <img src="experiment/images/ya_t.png"> is approximately constant within the sampling interval, at a value equal to that of the function at the preceding sampling instant. 

Therefore, for a given input sequence <img src="experiment/images/yk.png">, the output of ZOH is given by 

<img style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src= "experiment/images/eq2_intro.png">

The first two terms in expansion (1) are used to realize the first-order hold. For a given input sequence <img src="experiment/images/yk.png">, the output of the first-order hold is given by

<img style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src= "experiment/images/eq3.png">

It is obvious from expansion (1) that the higher the order of the derivative to be approximated, the larger will be the number of delay pulses required. The time-delay adversely affects the stability of feedback control systems. 

Furthermore, a high-order extrapolation requires complex circuitry and results in high costs of construction. The ZOH is the simplest, and most commonly used, data hold device. 
The standard D/A converters are often designed in such a way that the old value is held constant until a new conversion is ordered.
